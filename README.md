We suppose that we want to build a binary file named "PERSONNEL-ANP_DZ.bin" containing the
active personnel of the National People's Army of the six military regions. This file will
be organized according to the "LObarreVC" method: file seen as List, not Ordered, with
records of Variables size and accepting overlaps between blocks. The size of a block
is 1024 bytes.
